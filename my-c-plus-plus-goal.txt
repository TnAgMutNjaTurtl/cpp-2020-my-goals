Having a dual degree in CIS and IT I would like to go into the corporation world for a IT career. I opt to take C++ in substitution for C# via department approval, for a more IT oriented educational path. Prior to this semester, I asked around to what program languages to expect in a professional IT setting. Although C# was not complete brushed off the table it was clear that taking Python and C++ would be more beneficial to a career I am seeking. So the largest part of C++ I would like to learn would be the base to almost all creation in C++, so when faced with a code problem I will be able to attempt to understand the problem and not have to report to my boss that we will have to bring in a developer.
